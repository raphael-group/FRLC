# FRLC

This is the repository for the paper "Low-rank optimal transport through factor relaxation with latent coupling" which computes an LC-factorization as an interpretable means of decomposing a coupling matrix for general OT costs (W, GW, FGW) and relaxations (balanced, semi-relaxed, and unbalanced).
